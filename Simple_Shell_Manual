.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a basic command-line interpreter for UNIX-like operating systems. It provides a simple interface to interact with the operating system by reading commands from the user and executing them. This shell supports standard input and output redirection, piping between commands, and simple built-in commands such as `cd`, `exit`, and `env`.

The project aims to replicate the core functionalities of a typical shell in a simplified form, offering an educational insight into how command interpreters work. The project was developed as part of the ALX Software Engineering program to enhance understanding of system calls, process management, and file operations in UNIX.
